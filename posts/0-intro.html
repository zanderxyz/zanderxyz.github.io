  <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Among many of those who have studied a lot of economics or finance, there’s often a sense that economics quantifies and explains the real world. It’s a tempting viewpoint, as it lets decision makers replace subjective judgements with models, and point to numbers thrown out of them as “proof” that what they’re doing is right.</p>
<p>The problem is simple: it gives a completely false sense of understanding.</p>
<p>Conventional macroeconomic models start off with a series of assumptions (individual agents, rational behaviour, ignoring stock of financial assets, ..) that simplify the calculations, but lead to a house of cards that falls apart if you look at it too closely.</p>
<p>At their best, models can give us a way to project the incredibly complex real world into a simpler space with fewer variables. Finance is a huge driver behind growth in the real economy, and recessions in the real world are caused when mistakes in the financial world intrude on real life.</p>
<p>I present here a very simple alternative model of the financial world, and explain how we can use it to build an economy that is self-sustaining.</p>
<p>There will be no attempts here to quantify non-financial benefits or costs. Many of the best developments in the real world give non-financial benefits but come with financial costs, and limiting the model in this way forces us to pay these costs rather than letting them build up before they cause a crash.</p>
<p>We will start by talking about <a href="1-assets.html">Assets</a>.</p>
