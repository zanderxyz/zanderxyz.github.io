  <h1>12 Monetary Policy</h1>
<h2>Conventional</h2>
<p>The Bank of England changes policy by adjusting the Bank Rate, which is the rate of <span class="bg-green-lighter border border-green-lightest px-2">Interest</span> they pay on <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> deposited with them by commercial banks. This rate affects the economy via two routes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Lower Interest decreases the demand from banks for Currency, and increases their demand for Savings, raising their price. More valuable Savings make consumers and companies richer, encouraging them to spend more on Consumption and raising their Multipliers. <cinterest-down></cinterest-down><arrow></arrow><equity-up></equity-up><debt-up></debt-up><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><income-up></income-up></p>
</li>
<li><p>A lower Bank Rate leads to lower rates on deposits and mortgages. This encourages consumers and companies to borrow and spend, causing more debt to be issued and increasing GNI.<cinterest-down></cinterest-down><arrow></arrow><interest-down></interest-down><arrow></arrow><debt-up></debt-up><equity-up></equity-up><gni-up></gni-up><income-down></income-down></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Raising the policy rate has the opposite effects:
<cinterest-up></cinterest-up><arrow></arrow><interest-up></interest-up><equity-down></equity-down><gni-down></gni-down></p>
<p>Notice that raising rates doesn’t actually decrease the amount of Debt, just discourages any further increase. This asymmetry means that cutting then raising interest rates will not have zero overall effect, but will temporarily increase the total amount of Debt and slow future GNI growth until it is paid back. <cinterest-down></cinterest-down><cinterest-up></cinterest-up><arrow></arrow><debt-up></debt-up><arrow></arrow><income-down></income-down></p>
<p>This approach has worked very well for a long time, but always ends up increasing the total amount of Debt. As Debt slows GNI growth, even more Debt is then required to keep GNI on track. Interest rates have fallen consistently since the 1970s and couldn’t be cut any further during the 2008 financial crisis, resulting in a long recession.</p>
<p>Conventional monetary policy cannot keep working indefinitely - it is a feedback loop of ever-increasing debt. <debt-up></debt-up><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><income-down></income-down><arrow></arrow><debt-up></debt-up><cycle></cycle></p>
<h2>Unconventional</h2>
<p>Surprisingly unconventional policy is actually much simpler: the Bank of England can increase or decrease the amount of <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> in circulation, either temporarily or permanently.</p>
<h3>Temporary</h3>
<p>Quantitative Easing (QE) is an example of a way to achieve this temporarily.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bank of England buys government bonds in exchange for Currency
</li>
<li>This reduces Debt <debt-down></debt-down> and increases Currency <currency-up></currency-up>
</li>
<li>When the bonds redeem, their face value is paid to the Bank of England, removing it from circulation <currency-down></currency-down>
</li>
<li>The government replaces this with new Debt, thus returning us to where we started <debt-up></debt-up>
</li>
<li>Overall there is no net effect after the bond has matured <currency-flat></currency-flat><debt-flat></debt-flat>
</li>
</ul>

    <div class="w-16 h-10 text-left p-1 mr-4">Before</div>
    <assets v-bind:assets="before" classes="mb-1 h-8 w-64"></assets>
</div><div class="container w-2/3 flex mt-2">

    <assets v-bind:assets="after" classes="mb-1 h-8 w-64"></assets>
</div><p><code class="inline">Change in distribution of assets from QE</code></p>
<p>Despite having only a temporary effect, QE does have a positive effect on GNI while it is active, via its effect on other asset prices.</p>
<p>Raising the amount of <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> in circulation while keeping it’s demand constant will increase the value of Savings. This makes consumers and companies richer, encouraging them to spend more on Consumption and raising their Multipliers. <currency-up></currency-up><arrow></arrow><equity-up></equity-up><debt-up></debt-up><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><income-up></income-up></p>
<h3>Permanent</h3>
<p>A more permanent way to get the same effects would be for the Bank of England to print <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> and spend it on <span class="bg-blue-light border border-blue px-2">Consumption</span>.</p>
<p>This idea suffers from a very significant flaw: choosing where to spend the money is inherently political. It seems wrong to have an unelected central bank deciding where to target this, while the government and opposition argue about where tax rises and cuts should fall. This is also a solid criticism of QE, since it targets banks and bondholders. Are they really the most in need of help?</p>
<p>Furthermore, remember that our targets for GNI growth are symmetric - if growth is too high one year then we need a way to remove the new money from circulation. This is difficult for the Bank of England to achieve by themselves.</p>
<p>If new <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> is going to be injected into the economy, the government should be deciding how that money is spent, not the Bank of England.</p>
