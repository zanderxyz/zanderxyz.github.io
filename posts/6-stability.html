  <h1>6 Stability</h1>
<p>Now we can start to think about policy - we want our economy to be stable and consistent. We can aim for this in two ways.</p>
<h2>Unemployment</h2>
<p>Whenever unemployment rises sharply, there is a risk that some people struggle to get back into work during the recovery and end up unemployed for a long time. This is a deadweight loss to society, and a stable unemployment rate will help avoid it.</p>
<p>A major driver for sharp rises in unemployment is a fall in total wages paid to workers. If the total wage paid ever shrinks from one year to the next, then, given most workers are on fixed salary contracts, some of them must lose their jobs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Total <span class="bg-blue-light border border-blue px-1">Wages</span> must rise every year</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Sharing in Growth</h2>
<p>We want to ensure that people who borrow money (to start or grow businesses, or to buy houses) or lend it (banks creating new money for loans, or people investing their savings) have confidence that future growth won’t be skewed in favour of the other side of the loan. If all growth goes to borrowers, or all goes to lenders, this will create unnecessary volatility and instability.</p>
<h3>Inflation Targeting</h3>
<p>The Bank of England targets a low and stable inflation rate of 2%. If this is successfully achieved, then the real value of the interest paid on the loan will be the same regardless of what has happened to real GNI. This means lenders are guaranteed to receive the same real payment regardless of what happens to the economy, but the borrower is fully exposed to changes in real GNI growth. During periods of faster than expected growth, borrowers will profit from this, but in periods where growth is slower they will lose out.</p>
<blockquote><p>As growth has been slowing since the post-war boom, this has acted for years as a hidden transfer of income from borrowers to lenders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if inflation targeting doesn’t work, what can we do instead?</p>
<h3>Nominal Income Targeting</h3>
<p>We know that, on average, a person’s real income will grow proportionally to real GNI. This follows straight from the fact that GNI is the sum of all incomes.</p>
<p>Now assume a loan is taken out, and the real incomes of the borrower and lender are proportional to real GNI. Then their total incomes afterwards can only remain proportional if the real value of the final loan payment is also proportional.</p>
<p>If the loan payment is $L$, then at the end of the loan the real value of that loan payment will be $ L * \frac{real GNI}{nominal GNI} $. For this to be proportional to real GNI at the time the loan is taken out, we need nominal GNI at the end of the loan to be a constant.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-1">GNI</span> must change at a consistent rate to ensure borrowers and lenders both share in future economic growth risks</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Level Targeting</h3>
<p>We assumed above that the Bank of England would be able to achieve it’s objective consistently, but GNI and inflation are notoriously difficult to predict. What if nominal GNI one year grows faster than the target, but real GNI was as expected? This would mean inflation was too high, which would in turn mean the real value of the final loan payment would be too low - the borrower would profit and the lender would lose out.</p>
<p>To fix this, the Bank of England can promise to make up for any errors - if nominal GNI grows too fast one year then in future years it must grow more slowly to ensure the target is met on average. Rather than looking at annual growth rates, targets for the level of nominal GNI in future years should be set and those targets should not be changed if growth temporarily varies. If nominal GNI undershoots, everyone would know that it is expected to catch up in future, and if it overshoots, everyone would know it will slow down. This prevents both extended depressions and periods of hyperinflation.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bank of England must target the absolute level of <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-1">GNI</span> across a range of future years, and promise to make up for any mistakes</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The safe way to hit all of these targets is to aim to have constant <span class="bg-grey-light border border-grey-lighter px-1">GNI growth</span> comfortably above 0%, such as 5-7%. That way, even if growth is slow one year, <span class="bg-blue-light border border-blue px-1">Wages</span> will still rise and a recession is avoided.</p>
