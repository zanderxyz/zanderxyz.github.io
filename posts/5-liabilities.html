  <h1>5 Liabilities</h1>
<p>Liabilities are the opposite side of the balance sheet from Assets. Just as Savings are an Asset to the person receiving income from it, Savings are a Liability for the person or people paying that income.</p>
<h3>Example - Property and Mortgages</h3>
<p>A landlord who rents out a house has Equity in the house as an Asset, and their mortgage as a liability (we assume here that 20% is paid off):
<assets-liabilities :assets="house" :liabilities="mortgage" classes="w-64"></assets-liabilities></p>
<p>A tenant who lives in the house has Equity in the house as a Liability, as they must pay rent to live there:
<assets-liabilities :assets="various" :liabilities="house" classes="w-64"></assets-liabilities></p>
<p>The bank has the mortgage Debt as an Asset:
<assets-liabilities :assets="mortgage" :liabilities="various23" classes="w-64"></assets-liabilities></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Looked at more generally, for our three types of Asset:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> is only ever a liability of the Bank of England, as they are the only ones that can produce it</p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="bg-yellow border border-yellow-dark px-2">Equity</span> and <span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Debt</span> are liabilities of whoever is paying the <span class="bg-yellow-light border border-yellow-lighter px-2">Dividends</span> or <span class="bg-red-lighter border border-red-lightest px-2">Interest</span>. On first look, this is the company who issued the equity or debt. But the company is just a middle man - ultimately the dividends and interest are paid by consumers who buy products from the company.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Considered across the whole of society, <span class="bg-orange-light border border-orange px-2">Savings</span> are a Liability for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example of how our model differs from the real world by design. Even though the customers of a company are benefiting from the arrangement through the products they buy, in our financial model we only see the downside from their perspective - the money they must pay.</p>
