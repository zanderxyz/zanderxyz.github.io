  <h1>21 Exchange Rates</h1>
<p>In the long term, the value of one currency relative to another one is driven by expectations for real growth in the two countries in question. This is very similar to supply-driven inflation, in that we cannot control it directly.</p>
<p>Short-term exchange rates, however, are driven by many factors that can be influenced more easily, one of which is the interest rate paid on bank deposits.</p>
<h3>Interest Rate Parity</h3>
<p>Suppose one year bank deposit rates are 2% in the United States, and 0% in the United Kingdom. Somebody with GBP 1,000 could convert their money into USD, deposit it in a US bank for a year, and then convert the money back into GBP to earn a free 2% - <em>as long as the GBPUSD exchange rate doesnâ€™t change</em>.</p>
<p>GBPUSD Spot = 1.3 =&gt; 1 GBP = 1.3 USD
USD Rate = 3%
GBP Rate = 1%
GBPUSD 1yF = GBPUSD Spot * (USD Rate / GBP Rate)</p>
<p>=&gt; Higher interest rates imply fall in FX over time</p>
<p>Suppose GBP rates rise. To keep parity, either:</p>
<ol>
<li>GBPUSD Spot rises (GBP strengthens)
</li>
<li>GBPUSD Forwards fall
</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice both.</p>
