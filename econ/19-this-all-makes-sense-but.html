  <h1>19 This all makes sense, but..</h1>
<p>How could economists and policymakers around the world get it so wrong?</p>
<p>I think there are a number of driving factors behind this.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium">conventional economic models</a> start off with a series of weird assumptions, including but not limited to: individual agents, rational behaviour, equilibrium states, and that levels of financial assets have no effect. These decisions seem to have been made primarily to make it easier for economists to develop the models.
</li>
</ol>
<p>On the flip side, however, these assumptions do not describe the real world, and no amount of shuffling the deckchairs will suddenly change that. They provide a seductive yet false sense of understanding, and lead to a house of cards that falls apart if you look at it too closely.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Second, too much focus on real output. Although this seems counter-intuitive, fixating on real parameters is likely to do more harm than good in the short-term, given the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_illusion">money illusion</a> that people suffer from.
</li>
</ol>
<p>As I explained in <a href="6-stability.html">Stability</a>, the best way to ensure future real growth is more evenly shared is to focus on nominal stability. It is also easier - central banks can affect nominal variables with ease, whereas the steps needed to increase real growth are far less clear.</p>
<p>Austerity is an example of a policy that aimed to increase real growth while ignoring nominal stability, to detrimental effect. Far better to build solid foundations first.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Third, conventional thinking entrenches existing wealth and privilege. If you are an already-wealthy politician, and want to stay that way relative to others, then increasing house prices as a way of raising incomes makes a lot of sense. It is, however, completely back-to-front.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The wider populationâ€™s fear that inflation reduces real incomes is exploited by politicians to discourage policies that would generate a modest amount of neutral demand-side inflation alongside rising nominal incomes. At the same time, they are happy to watch house prices inflate further, and rising rent payments reduce disposable income for people across the country.</p>
<p>Finally: <a href="20-conclusion.html">Conclusion</a></p>
