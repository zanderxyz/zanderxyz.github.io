  <h1>15 Recessions</h1>
<p>A recession is what we get when GNI shrinks from one year to the next. This lost income gives rise to an increase in unemployment and some businesses needing to close down. If future expectations for GNI growth fall, the impact on Assets and Income is as follows:</p>
<h2>Low Debt Society</h2>
<p><ai-change :ab="low_before" :ib="low_before_income" :aa="low_after" :ia="low_after_income"></ai-change></p>
<h2>High Debt Society</h2>
<p><ai-change :ab="high_before" :ib="high_before_income" :aa="high_after" :ia="high_after_income"></ai-change></p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li><ctext color="green-dark" text="Currency"></ctext>, <ctext color="green-light" text="Interest"></ctext>, <ctext color="teal-dark" text="Deposits"></ctext> &amp; <ctext color="teal-light" text="Interest"></ctext>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No change</p>
<ul>
<li><ctext color="yellow-dark" text="Equity"></ctext> &amp; <ctext color="yellow-light" text="Dividends"></ctext>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of Equity falls on lower growth expectations. Business profits fall, and companies cut their dividends to shareholders. Overall, Dividends fall by proportionally more than Equity.</p>
<p>Dividends as a share of GNI fall in both cases. <dividends-down></dividends-down></p>
<ul>
<li><ctext color="red-dark" text="Debt"></ctext> &amp; <ctext color="red-light" text="Interest"></ctext>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of Debt falls on the increased likelihood of companies defaulting. As most Debt pays a fixed rate of interest, these interest payments do not change along with the fall in value. Debt interest payments therefore only fall by a small amount in absolute terms.</p>
<p>In the low debt society, defaults take place without causing a cascade of further defaults, and therefore Debt interest payments fall as a share of GNI. <interest-down></interest-down></p>
<p>In the high debt society, widespread defaults are untenable due to the high share of Debt interest as a proportion of GNI. The Bank of England are forced to cut interest rates to prop up companies and keep them alive with cheap credit. The government may also step in to bail out companies or industries that have systemic value. In this situation a lower proportion of the debtors default, and Debt interest payments rise as a share of GNI. <interest-up></interest-up></p>
<ul>
<li><ctext color="blue-light" text="Wages"></ctext>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wages likely fall in absolute terms, causing job losses.</p>
<p>In the low debt society, they actually rise as a share of GNI due to the falling share of Dividends and Interest. <wages-up></wages-up></p>
<p>In the high debt society however, they fall as a share of GNI due to the rising share of GNI made up of Debt interest payments. <wages-down></wages-down></p>
<h2>After Effects</h2>
<p>In the low debt society, the economy seems well poised to bounce back. Wages as a share of <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-2">GNI</span> have risen <wages-up></wages-up>, which suggests the Structural Multiplier will have risen too <mult-up></mult-up>.</p>
<p>In the high debt society, things look very different. Although the value of <ctext color="orange-dark" text="Savings"></ctext> have fallen, the share of <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-2">GNI</span> going to workers has fallen by even more <wages-down></wages-down>, so we should expect a lower Structural Multiplier <mult-down></mult-down> and a lower Savings Ceiling.</p>
<p>In a crash, <ctext color="red-dark" text="Debt"></ctext> cannot contract smoothly the way that <ctext color="yellow-dark" text="Equity"></ctext> can. This means that afterwards the choice for policymakers is often between sudden defaults or an overhang of Debt that will cause a drag on GNI growth for years to come <income-down></income-down>.</p>
<p>TODO Rewrite after 14</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened in the United Kingdom during and after the 2008 financial crisis. The slow response from the Bank of England to the start of the trouble in 2007 forced the government into bailing out the banking industry, and this has left an excess of Debt hanging over society. It is highly likely that total Savings are currently greater than the Savings Ceiling.</p>
