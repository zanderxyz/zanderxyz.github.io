  <h1>7 Inflation</h1>
<p>Inflation is an overall increase in the price level of goods and services over a specified time period. These price increases can come from two distinct causes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increase in Aggregate Demand</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An increase in demand for goods and services will naturally raise their price. Although demand can rise and fall for individual goods for various reasons, if there has been a rise on aggregate this must come alongside a rise in <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-1">GNI</span>.</p>
<p>This type of inflation is therefore “neutral” - prices rise in nominal terms but stay the same in real terms, as incomes have risen as well.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Decrease in Aggregate Supply</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If there has been a decrease in the supply of goods and services, but demand stays the same, then prices will rise. There is no associated rise in incomes.</p>
<p>This type of inflation is therefore “bad” - prices rise in nominal and real terms.</p>
<blockquote><p>Deflation (a fall in the price level) comes from the two opposing causes - a decrease in demand (neutral) or an increase in supply (good).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Aggregate Supply</h3>
<p>It is changes in supply that affect how far people’s incomes stretch, and improve or reduce their quality of life. Unfortunately, however, we cannot directly control supply outcomes. Moves in the short run will come from shocks to the economy (e.g. a rise in the oil price reduces the supply of many goods), and in the long run they will come from productivity growth.</p>
<h3>Aggregate Demand</h3>
<p>Both increases and decreases in demand are “neutral” from an inflation standpoint, as they have no effect on real prices. However, in the last section we concluded that we want GNI to rise consistently at 5-7% per year. This rise in incomes will increase demand, and there will be inflation.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It is very unfortunate that only headline inflation figures are reported, as if the numbers were broken down into demand and supply this topic would be much better understood.</p>
<p>For now it suffices to say that inflation is not all bad, and there is no reason to fear inflation driven by rising incomes.</p>
