  <h1>7 Inflation</h1>
<p>Inflation is an overall increase in the price level of goods and services over a specified time period. These price increases can come from two distinct causes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increase in Aggregate Demand</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An increase in demand for goods and services will naturally raise their price. Although demand can rise and fall for individual goods for various reasons, if there has been a rise on aggregate this must come alongside a rise in <span class="bg-gray-400 border border-gray-600 px-1">GNI</span>.</p>
<p>This type of inflation is therefore “neutral” - prices rise in nominal terms but stay the same in real terms, as incomes have risen as well.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Decrease in Aggregate Supply</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If there has been a decrease in the supply of goods and services, but demand stays the same, then prices will rise. There is no associated rise in incomes.</p>
<p>This type of inflation is therefore “bad” - prices rise in nominal and real terms.</p>
<blockquote><p>Deflation (a fall in the price level) is driven by the two opposing causes - a decrease in demand (neutral) or an increase in supply (good).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<h3>Aggregate Supply</h3>
<p>It is changes in supply that affect how far people’s incomes stretch, and improve or reduce their quality of life. Unfortunately, however, we cannot directly control supply outcomes. Moves in the short-term will come from shocks to the economy (e.g. a rise in the oil price reduces the supply of many goods), and in the long-term they will come from real GNI growth.</p>
<h3>Aggregate Demand</h3>
<p>Although increases and decreases in demand are “neutral” from an inflation standpoint, in the last chapter we concluded that we want GNI to rise consistently at 5% per year. This rise in incomes will increase demand, and there will therefore be some inflation.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>It is very unfortunate that only headline inflation figures are reported, as if the numbers were broken down into estimates of demand and supply this topic would be much better understood.</p>
<p>For now it suffices to say that inflation is not all bad, and there is no reason to fear inflation driven by rising incomes.</p>
