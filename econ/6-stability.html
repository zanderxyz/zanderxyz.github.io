  <h1>6 Stability</h1>
<p>Now we can start to think about policy - we want our economy to be stable and consistent. We can aim for this in two ways:</p>
<h2>Shared Growth</h2>
<p>We want to ensure that people who borrow money (to start or grow businesses, or to buy houses) or lend it (banks creating new money for loans, or people investing their savings) have confidence that future growth won’t be skewed in favour of the other side of the loan. If all growth goes to borrowers, or all goes to lenders, this will skew incentives and create unnecessary volatility and instability.</p>
<h3>Inflation Targeting</h3>
<p>The Bank of England currently targets a low and stable inflation rate of 2% per annum. If they are successful, and annual inflation stays constant over time, then the real value of any future nominal payment will be known in advance. Specifically, the real value of the interest paid on any fixed-rate loan will not be affected by changes in real GNI.</p>
<p>This means lenders are guaranteed to receive the same real payment regardless of what happens to the economy, but borrowers are fully exposed to changes in real GNI growth. During periods of faster than expected growth, borrowers will profit from this, but in periods where growth is slower they will lose out.</p>
<blockquote><p>As growth has been slowing since the post-war boom, this has acted for years as a hidden transfer of income from borrowers to lenders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If inflation targeting doesn’t work, what can we do instead?</p>
<h3>Nominal Income Targeting</h3>
<p>We know that an average person’s real income will grow proportionally to real GNI. This follows straight from the fact that GNI is the sum of all incomes.</p>
<p>Now assume a loan is taken out, and the real incomes of the borrower and lender are proportional to real GNI. Then their total incomes afterwards can only remain proportional if the real value of the final loan payment is also proportional.</p>
<p>If the loan payment is $L$, then at the end of the loan the real value of that loan payment will be $ L * \frac{real GNI}{nominal GNI} $. For this to be proportional to real GNI at the time the loan is taken out, we need nominal GNI at the end of the loan to be a constant.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-1">GNI</span> must change at a consistent rate to ensure borrowers and lenders both share in future economic growth risks</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Level Targeting</h3>
<p>We assumed above that the Bank of England would be able to achieve it’s objective consistently, but GNI and inflation are notoriously difficult to predict. What if nominal GNI one year grows faster than the target, but real GNI was as expected? This would mean inflation was too high, which would in turn mean the real value of the final loan payment would be too low - the borrower would profit and the lender would lose out.</p>
<p>To fix this, the Bank of England can promise to make up for any errors - if nominal GNI grows too fast one year then in future years it must grow more slowly to ensure the target is met on average. Rather than looking at annual growth rates, targets for the level of nominal GNI in future years should be set and those targets should not be changed if growth temporarily varies. If nominal GNI undershoots, everyone would know that it is expected to catch up in future, and if it overshoots, everyone would know it will slow down. This prevents both extended depressions and periods of hyperinflation.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bank of England must target the level of <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-1">GNI</span> across a range of future years, and promise to make up for any mistakes</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Unemployment</h2>
<p>Avoiding sudden rises in unemployment is the reason why we need nominal growth at all. If total Wages fall from one year to the next, then, given most workers are on fixed salary contracts, some of them must have lost their jobs.</p>
<p>To avoid this, we target <span class="bg-grey-light border border-grey-lighter px-1">GNI growth</span> of comfortably higher than 0%. That way, even if growth is slow one year, <span class="bg-blue-light border border-blue px-1">Wages</span> should still rise and a recession can be avoided.</p>
<blockquote><p>The <span class="bg-grey-light border border-grey-lighter px-1">GNI growth</span> target must be positive, to maximise the chances that total <span class="bg-blue-light border border-blue px-1">Wages</span> rise every year</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Historic GDP Growth</h2>
<p>Using Gross Domestic Product as a proxy for GNI, we can observe historic trends to determine what target growth rates are reasonable.</p>
<p>Nominal GDP growth ran at 7.3% in the 1960s, 16.1% in the 1970s, 10.7% in the 1980s, 5.3% in the 1990s, 4.1% in the 2000s, and 2.8% through to June 2018.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at the trend figures over time, we can see that trend growth was very stable at 5.05% from 1990 to 2007, but since the low in 2009 it has only grown at 3.62%.</p>

</script><h2>New Target</h2>
<p>If I was selecting a new target now, a return to the 1990-2007 trend rate of 5% per year seems reasonable. One could also argue for a temporarily higher rate of 7-8% for 5-10 years, in an attempt to ‘catch back up’ to the old trend line.</p>
<p>Ultimately the exact target chosen is somewhat arbitrary, and the most important thing is setting a new permanent target. We can see in the chart above how growth suddenly switched to a lower path after the financial crisis of 2008, and after future crises this must be avoided.</p>
<h3>Nominal Targets</h3>
<p>It is important to emphasise that our targets for GNI growth are nominal, not real. Naturally the government and Bank of England should care about long-term real growth, but if they do so at the cost of nominal growth then they risk causing unnecessary volatility and damage to the economy.</p>
<p>It is stable nominal growth that builds the foundations that we need to achieve long-term prosperity.</p>
