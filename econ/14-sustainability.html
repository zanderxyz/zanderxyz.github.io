  <h1>14 Sustainability</h1>
<p>Recall that Savings are an Asset for their owners but a Liability for the rest of society since the interest or dividend they earn must come from somewhere.</p>
<p>If the amount of <ctext color="green-dark" text="Currency"></ctext> stays fixed, can the amount of <ctext color="orange-dark" text="Savings"></ctext> in the economy rise indefinitely?</p>
<p>Imagine a country with very low Savings: almost all income would be Wages. As most of this would be spent on Consumption, the Structural Multiplier <sm></sm> would be high.
<assets :assets="low_savings" classes="text-lg h-10"></assets>
<assets :assets="low_savings_income" classes="h-6"></assets></p>
<p>In contrast, imagine a country where most Wealth is Savings: most income would be interest or dividends and the asset distribution would look very different:
<assets :assets="high_savings" classes="text-lg h-10"></assets>
<assets :assets="high_savings_income" classes="h-6"></assets></p>
<p>If ownership of the Savings were evenly distributed throughout the population then this could be sustainable, but we know that in the real world there will be those with Savings and those without. A higher proportion of income will go to savers with a low Marginal Multiplier, and a lower proportion to workers with a high MM, so the Structural Multiplier <sm></sm> will be lower.</p>
<p>At some high level of Savings the Structural Multiplier will fall below 100%, and this leads us to need new money every year to keep GNI on track. If this money comes from Debt, this leads us straight to the feedback loop of falling interest rates and rising Debt levels. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><mult-down></mult-down><income-down></income-down><arrow></arrow><debt-plus></debt-plus><cycle></cycle></p>
<h2>Savings Ceiling</h2>
<p>There must be some cap on the total amount of Assets that can sustainably be Savings. Although we can’t actually determine what this is as it will depend on too many variables (future rates of return on all assets and their distribution across the population), we’ll call this the Savings Ceiling - it is the maximum amount of Assets that can be Savings without starting the feedback loop of ever-increasing Debt.</p>
<p><assets :assets="mid_savings" classes="text-lg h-10"></assets>
<assets :assets="ceiling" classes="h-6 mt-2"></assets></p>
<p>If we want to build a sustainable economy, we must prevent the proportion of Savings from growing indefinitely.</p>
