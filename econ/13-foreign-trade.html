  <h1>13 Foreign Trade</h1>
<p>Up until now we have been considering a closed economy, but in the real world we trade with other countries. Fortunately this changes very little in our model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money entering the country will immediately add to GNI <gni-up></gni-up>
</li>
<li>Money leaving the country will have a very low Multiplier <gni-down></gni-down>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four situations to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exports
</li>
</ol>
<p>Goods and services produced at home and sold abroad; these are included in income already. Exports give an immediate boost to GNI as new money enters the country <gni-up></gni-up></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Imports
</li>
</ol>
<p>Goods and services purchased from abroad, these are also already included; this expenditure will have a very low Multiplier as the money leaves the country <gni-down></gni-down></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Foreign Investment
</li>
</ol>
<p>Selling <span class="bg-orange-light border border-orange px-2">Savings</span> to a foreign buyer; this acts like new <span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Debt</span> as the new money gives an initial boost to GNI <gni-up></gni-up> but will slow future growth <income-down></income-down> as dividends and interest payments leave the country</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Overseas Investment
</li>
</ol>
<p>Buying overseas Savings; the opposite to foreign investment, this will initially slow GNI <gni-down></gni-down> as the money spent leaves the country but then increase future growth <income-up></income-up> as dividends and interest payments flow back</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance of Trade</strong> is the value of a country’s Exports minus its Imports in any given year
</li>
<li><span class="bg-purple-light border border-purple px-2">Current Account</span> is a country’s Balance of Trade plus the value of dividends and interest received on Overseas Investments, minus dividends and interest paid on Foreign Investments
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>A Current Account surplus means that a country is receiving more than it is paying out from abroad, which will act as new money that gives a boost to GNI growth <ca-up></ca-up><arrow></arrow><income-up></income-up>. In contrast, a country with a Current Account deficit is a net borrower from the rest of the world, and will need to offset this drag with new money <ca-down></ca-down><arrow></arrow><income-down></income-down>. The Current Account balances across all countries in the world must sum to zero, so this is a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom currently has a Current Account deficit of roughly £80bn per year (~4% of GDP) and the last year it ran a surplus was 1983 (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/timeseries/hbop/pnbp">source</a>). This isn’t inherently bad: by definition, not all countries can simultaneously run a surplus. But it does mean that more new money is needed each year than it otherwise would be, and it likely has a long-term effect on the strength of the Pound.</p>
<p>Additionally, when looking at scarce assets that everyone needs such as housing or energy, allowing an increasing proportion to be bought by overseas buyers for investment purposes can be very bad for the local economy, as an increasing proportion of workers’ income needs to be spent on rent/mortgage payments. This means less local Consumption and a slowing economy.</p>
