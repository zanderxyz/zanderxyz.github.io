  <h1>13 Foreign Trade</h1>
<p>Up until now we have been considering a closed economy, but in the real world we trade with other countries. Fortunately this changes very little:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money entering the country will immediately add to GNI <money-plus></money-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up>
</li>
<li>Money leaving the country will have a very low Multiplier <money-minus></money-minus><arrow></arrow><gni-down></gni-down>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four situations to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exports</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Goods and services produced at home and sold abroad, these are included in income already. Exports give an immediate boost to GNI as new money enters the country <money-plus></money-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Imports</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Goods and services purchased from abroad; this expenditure will have a very low Multiplier as the money leaves the country <money-minus></money-minus><arrow></arrow><gni-down></gni-down></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Foreign Investment</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Selling <ctext color="orange-dark" text="Savings"></ctext> to a foreign buyer; this acts similarly to new <ctext color="red-dark" text="Debt"></ctext> as the new money gives an initial boost to GNI but will slow future growth as dividends and interest payments leave the country <money-plus></money-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><income-down></income-down></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Overseas Investment</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Buying overseas Savings; the opposite to Foreign Investment, this will initially slow GNI  as the money spent leaves the country but then increase future growth as dividends and interest payments flow back <money-minus></money-minus><arrow></arrow><gni-down></gni-down><income-up></income-up></p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Balance of Trade</strong> is the value of a country’s Exports minus its Imports in any given year
</li>
<li><ctext color="pink-dark" text="Current Account"></ctext> is a country’s Balance of Trade plus the value of dividends and interest received on Overseas Investments, minus dividends and interest paid on Foreign Investments
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Effects of Trade</h2>
<p>A <ctext color="pink-dark" text="Current Account"></ctext> surplus means that a country is receiving more than it is paying out from abroad, which will act as new money that gives a boost to GNI growth <ca-up></ca-up><arrow></arrow><income-up></income-up>. In contrast, a country with a Current Account deficit is a net borrower from the rest of the world, and will need to offset this drag with new money <ca-down></ca-down><arrow></arrow><income-down></income-down>. The Current Account balances across all countries in the world must sum to zero, so this is a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom currently has a Current Account deficit of roughly £80bn per year (~4% of GDP) and the last year it ran a surplus was 1983 (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/timeseries/hbop/pnbp">source</a>). This isn’t inherently bad: by definition, not all countries can simultaneously run a surplus. But it does mean that more new money is needed each year than it otherwise would be.</p>
<h3>Deficit Advantages</h3>
<p>The main upside of running a deficit is that it will result in a stronger currency, as foreign investors need to buy pounds if they want to invest in the UK. This flow of investment money will naturally raise exchange rates.</p>
<h3>Deficit Disadvantages</h3>
<p>The main downside of high levels of foreign investment comes where the investments focus on scarce assets that are needed by everybody (such as housing). Allowing these to be bought by overseas buyers is good in the short term, as the additional buyers increase the price of these assets <equity-up></equity-up>, giving a short-term boost for local owners.</p>
<p>However, a higher price means that an increasing proportion of workers’ income needs to be spent on rent/mortgage payments <dividends-up></dividends-up> that leave the country <gni-down></gni-down>. This means lower Consumption spending, a lower Structural Multiplier <mult-down></mult-down> and lower GNI growth <income-down></income-down>.</p>
