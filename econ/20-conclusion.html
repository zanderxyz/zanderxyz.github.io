  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Starting with a set of sensible definitions for assets and income, and building from there, we have created a simple alternative model of the financial world, and explained how we can use it to build an economy that is sustainable.</p>
<p>At their best, models can give us a way to project the incredibly complex real world into a simpler space with fewer variables. I make no claims that the work offered here provides a complete “theory of everything”, and no doubt there are improvements that can be made.</p>
<p>Strikingly, many of the conclusions we have drawn align with the “common sense” of most people, if not the views of economic experts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encouraging debt begets a vicious circle of even more debt
</li>
<li>QE primarily served to inflate house prices and the stock market
</li>
<li>Austerity as implemented was not properly thought through
</li>
<li>Allowing foreign buyers to own half of London property is unambiguously bad
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>Ultimately the solutions I propose rely on reform of the Bank of England led by Parliament, and would increase the powers of the Bank at the expense of the government.</p>
<p>Although this may require a government with unusual foresight, it was only in 1997 that the incoming Labour government announced the Bank of England would be handed the freedom to set interest rates without government interference, and this has been widely lauded as a successful move. In this context, a further move to reduce political interference does not seem impossible to achieve.</p>
