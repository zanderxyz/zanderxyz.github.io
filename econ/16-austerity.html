  <h1>16 Austerity</h1>
<p>Austerity is the government policy of pursuing deficit reduction, with the aim of running a balanced budget, with no new Government Debt.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the cost of the 2008 bank bailout and a fall in tax receipts caused Government Debt to increase from 40% of GDP in 2007 to 75% in 2010. This prompted the newly elected Conservative government to aggressively pursue deficit reduction via cuts to welfare programs and widespread public sector job losses, mirroring similar approaches in Southern Europe.</p>
<p>Applying our understanding of different sources of new money, we can see that any reduction in the government deficit would slow growth unless this was replaced with another source. There are three other sources that could have been chosen:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Private Debt</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a completely reasonable alternative that makes sense if you are a proponent of small governments. If one starts off with the assumption that government run programs are inherently inefficient, then one probably ascribes a lower Multiplier <mult></mult> to government spending than the spending of private companies. This then suggests that cutting government spending while encouraging an increase in Private Debt might be an overall benefit to the economy.</p>
<p>There are, however, a few obvious problems with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest rates were already at all-time lows, and couldn’t be reduced any further to encourage an increase in Private Debt.
</li>
<li>The government spending that was cut was the spending with the highest Multipliers (unemployment benefit, for example, is all spent by its recipients, so cutting it is a direct cut to GNI <gni-down></gni-down>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>To encourage more borrowing without reducing interest rates the government was forced to introduce policies to encourage mortgage borrowing. This naturally boosted (already elevated) house prices further, increasing the value of Savings <debt-up></debt-up><equity-up></equity-up>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span class="bg-purple-light border border-purple px-2">Foreign Trade</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be thought of as the Germany approach. Germany runs the world’s largest Current Account surplus of roughly $300 billion per year (~8% of GDP). If you’re a country in that position, then there is no need to fuel GNI growth using new Debt of any kind.</p>
<p>It is, however, not possible to simply wish ones Current Account deficit will become a surplus and have it come true, and no steps were taken by the government to encourage a transition in that direction (which of course would take time, and only affect the long-term).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Quantitative Easing was introduced by the Bank of England in 2009 once the Bank Rate couldn’t be cut any further. In 2011 and 2012, the programme was increased further in an attempt to offset the effects of reduced government spending.</p>
<p>Although somewhat successful in this regard, predictably this came about by further inflating the value of Savings <debt-up></debt-up><equity-up></equity-up>, thus reducing the Structural Multiplier <mult-down></mult-down> and moving us ever further from an economy that is self-sustaining.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Our model explains clearly how an ostensibly sensible policy can end up doing more harm than good. Governments across the world continue to focus on the short-term to the detriment of the long term prosperity of their countries.</p>
