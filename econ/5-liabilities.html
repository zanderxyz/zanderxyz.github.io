  <h1>5 Liabilities</h1>
<p>Liabilities are the opposite side of the balance sheet from Assets. Just as <ctext color="orange-dark" text="Savings"></ctext> are an Asset to the person receiving income from it, they are a Liability for the people paying that income.</p>
<h3>Example - Property and Mortgages</h3>
<p>A landlord who rents out a house has Equity in the house as an Asset, and their mortgage as a liability (we assume here that 20% is paid off):
<assets-liabilities :assets="housea" :liabilities="mortgage" classes="w-64"></assets-liabilities></p>
<p>A tenant who lives in the house has Equity in the house as a Liability, as they must pay rent to live there:
<assets-liabilities :assets="various" :liabilities="housel" classes="w-64"></assets-liabilities></p>
<p>The bank has the mortgage Debt as an Asset:
<assets-liabilities :assets="mortgage" :liabilities="various23" classes="w-64"></assets-liabilities></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Looked at more generally, for our three types of Asset:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><ctext color="green-dark" text="Currency"></ctext> is only ever a liability of the Bank of England</p>
</li>
<li><p><ctext color="yellow-dark" text="Equity"></ctext> and <ctext color="red-dark" text="Debt"></ctext> are liabilities of whoever is paying the <ctext color="yellow-light" text="Dividends"></ctext> or <ctext color="red-light" text="Debt Interest"></ctext>. At first this is the company who issued the Equity or Debt, but the company is just a middle man - ultimately the dividends and interest are paid by consumers who buy products from the company.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Considered across the whole of society, <ctext color="orange-dark" text="Savings"></ctext> are a Liability for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example of how our model differs from the real world by design. Even though the customers of a company are benefiting from the arrangement through the products they buy, in our financial model we only see the downside from their perspective - the money they must pay.</p>
