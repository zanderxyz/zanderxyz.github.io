  <h1>2 Income</h1>
<p>We can continue by categorising all income into groups that are closely related to the Asset groups:</p>
<ol>
<li><ctext color="green-light" text="Currency Interest"></ctext> - Return on <ctext color="green-dark" text="Currency"></ctext>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As banknotes and coins earn no interest, banks are the only ones who can receive interest on Currency. They do this by depositing it with the Bank of England, and are paid the Bank Rate in return.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><ctext color="red-light" text="Debt Interest"></ctext> - Return on <ctext color="red-dark" text="Debt"></ctext>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All Debt pays interest of some kind, usually a fixed amount per year.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><ctext color="yellow-light" text="Dividends"></ctext> - Return on <ctext color="yellow-dark" text="Equity"></ctext>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although some equity assets donâ€™t pay a return directly, many do. Examples of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividends paid to shareholders of a company
</li>
<li>Rent paid to a landlord who rents out a house
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><ctext color="blue-light" text="Wages"></ctext>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This covers any kind of income that does not come from an Asset. It is primarily comprised of wages from employment, but also includes gifts and benefits paid by the government.</p>
<h2>Total Income</h2>
<p>All income received comes from one of these four sources. The overall proportion of each will vary over time and be influenced by the make-up of assets held. In aggregate across the country it may look similar to this.</p>
<p>Assets
<assets :assets="assets" classes="text-lg h-10"></assets>
Income
<assets :assets="income" classes="h-6"></assets>
<span class="text-base">(not to scale)</span></p>
<p>Although time passes continuously in the real world, we measure time-dependent variables like income with reference to a specific time period. A year is a convenient default to use, as many measures of income (such as wages) are already quoted on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Income can be quoted in nominal or real terms. Nominal income is measured in the relevant currency, whereas real income is adjusted for changes in inflation since a specified date. For example, if you get a pay rise of 1% but prices have risen by 2% since last year, then your real wage has fallen by ~1%.</p>
