  <h1>2 Income</h1>
<p>We can continue by categorising all income into four groups that are closely related to the Asset groups:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bg-green-lighter border border-green-lightest px-2">Interest</span> - Return on <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As banknotes and coins earn no interest, banks are the only ones who can receive interest on Currency. They do this by depositing it with the Bank of England, and are paid the Bank Rate in return.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span class="bg-yellow-light border border-yellow-lighter px-2">Dividends</span> - Return on <span class="bg-yellow border border-yellow-dark px-2">Equity</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although some equity assets donâ€™t pay a return directly, many do. Examples of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dividends paid to shareholders of a company
</li>
<li>Rent paid to a landlord who rents out a house
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><span class="bg-red-lighter border border-red-lightest px-2">Interest</span> - Return on <span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Debt</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Almost all Debt pays Interest of some kind, usually a fixed amount per year.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><span class="bg-blue-lighter border border-blue-lightest px-2">Wages</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This covers any kind of income that does not come from an Asset. It is primarily comprised of wages from employment, but also includes gifts and benefits paid by the government.</p>
<h2>Total Income</h2>
<p>All income received comes from one of these four sources. The overall proportion of each will vary over time and be influenced by the make-up of assets held. In aggregate across the country it may look similar to this.</p>
<p><assets :assets="assets" classes="text-lg h-10"></assets>
<assets :assets="income" classes="h-6"></assets></p>
<p>Although time passes continuously in the real world, we measure time-dependent variables like income with reference to a specific time period. A year is a convenient default to use, as many measures of income (such as wages) are already quoted on an annual basis.</p>
<p>Income can be quoted in nominal or real terms. Nominal income is measured in the relevant currency, whereas real income is adjusted for changes in inflation since a specified date. For example, if you get a pay rise of 1% but prices have risen by 2% since last year, then your real wage has fallen by ~1%.</p>
