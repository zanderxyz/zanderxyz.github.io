  <h1>4 Saving</h1>
<p>Any income received that isn’t spent on Consumption has been saved. Saving involves buying <span class="bg-yellow border border-yellow-dark px-2">Equity</span> or <span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Debt</span> - together these comprise <span class="bg-orange-light border border-orange px-2">Savings</span>. Remember that money in your bank account is Debt, so is included here.</p>
<p>As we know, anything spent on <span class="bg-blue-light border border-blue px-2">Consumption</span> becomes income for other people. This leads us to the fact that if somebody chooses to save some of their income instead of spending it, then this will directly reduce the total income of other people by that same amount.</p>
<h2>Multipliers</h2>
<p>Suppose we take somebody’s income and break it down into Consumption and Savings. The Consumption spending becomes income for others so we can split it into Consumption and Savings again.</p>
<p>Continuing in this manner until the year ends, and adding up all the Consumption, we will get a number giving us the additional contribution to <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-2">GNI</span> of the original income received. Dividing this by the original income gives us the Multiplier <mult></mult> of that income.</p>

<p>Every recipient of income has their own Multiplier <mult></mult> and their own Marginal Multiplier, which is the incremental Multiplier for a small change in income. Generally speaking, somebody living pay cheque to pay cheque will have a high Marginal Multiplier, whereas the CEO of a large company will have a low MM, as they will save most of their pay.</p>
<p>The Multiplier <mult></mult> can be lower than 100% (if the savings rate is high, or if money is spent slowly), or it can be higher than 100% (if the savings rate is low, or if money is spent and re-spent quickly).</p>
