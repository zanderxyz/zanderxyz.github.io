  <h1>4 Saving</h1>
<p>Any income received that isn’t spent on Consumption has been saved. Saving involves buying <ctext color="yellow-dark" text="Equity"></ctext> or <ctext color="red-dark" text="Debt"></ctext> - together these comprise <ctext color="orange-dark" text="Savings"></ctext>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember that money in your bank account is Debt, so money in your bank account is part of Savings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we know, anything spent on <ctext color="blue-dark" text="Consumption"></ctext> becomes income for other people. This leads us to the fact that if somebody chooses to save some of their income instead of spending it, then this will directly reduce the total income of other people by that same amount.</p>
<h2>Multipliers</h2>
<p>We need a way to describe how some income leads to total income (GNI) rising, and some doesn’t. We can do this with something we call the Multiplier. <mult></mult></p>
<p>Suppose we take somebody’s income and break it down into Savings and Consumption. The money spent on Consumption becomes new income for others. After that income is received we can split it again into Savings and Consumption (which turns into more new income).</p>
<p>If we keep doing this until the year ends, and then add up all the new income (which will equal the total spent on Consumption), we get a number that represents the additional income generated by the original income received. Dividing this by the original income gives us the Multiplier <mult></mult> of that income.</p>

</div><p><code class="inline">Income received contributes to GNI again as it is spent; here the Multiplier is approximately 100%</code></p>
<p>Every recipient of income has their own Multiplier <mult></mult> and their own Marginal Multiplier, which is the incremental Multiplier for a small change in income. Generally speaking, somebody living paycheque to paycheque will have a high Marginal Multiplier, whereas the CEO of a large company will have a low MM, as they will save most of their pay.</p>
<p>The Multiplier will also be different for different types of income. Generally speaking, the Multiplier for Wages will be higher than the Multipliers for Dividends and Interest. This is because of the unequal distribution of Savings across the population.</p>
<p>The Multiplier <mult></mult> can be lower than 100% (if the savings rate is high, or if money is spent slowly), or it can be higher than 100% (if the savings rate is low, or if money is spent and re-spent quickly).</p>
<h2>Tax Policy</h2>
<p>Current UK policy encourages saving by offering tax breaks on pensions and ISAs. For each individual, saving makes sense, as it makes them richer relative to others. Considered across the whole population however, saving slows GNI growth <income-down></income-down>, and in the long run makes everyone poorer.</p>
<p>Encouraging acts that help individuals but hurt society are <em>exactly the opposite</em> of what the government should be doing.</p>
