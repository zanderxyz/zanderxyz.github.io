  <h1>9 Money</h1>
<p>Money is what we use when we are exchanging one Asset for another. We call it the “Medium of Exchange.”</p>
<p>The fact that it isn’t one of the components of Wealth may initially seem confusing but it is a mistake to think of money as purely a stock variable when it is really a flow, the oil that keeps the economy running.</p>
<p>Assets can be money if we can exchange them for other Assets. There is no precise dividing line between money and non-money, so some Assets may be money only in some situations.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li><ctext color="green-dark" text="Currency"></ctext> is definitely money, in all circumstances. It is also the “Medium of Account”, as prices are conventionally displayed in it.
</li>
<li><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Bank deposits</span> are also money now that most transactions are made electronically, as long as the bank is safe (in the UK they are also guaranteed by the government up to £85k per person)
</li>
<li><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Short-dated government bonds</span> are nearly money, as they trade in a liquid market so can easily be exchanged for deposits. Additionally their value is very stable and unlikely to vary much in the time it takes to sell them
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other assets are kind of similar to money but fall down in some ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Long-dated government bonds</span> are equally as easy to exchange for deposits, but their value can change by a lot if interest rates move suddenly
</li>
<li><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Short-dated bonds from safe companies</span> are less liquid and more risky than government bonds
</li>
</ul>
<p>And then other assets are not really like money at all:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Long-dated or high-yield bonds</span> are more illiquid and more likely to change value quickly
</li>
<li><span class="bg-yellow border border-yellow-dark px-2">Shares</span> can change value dramatically from one day to the next
</li>
<li><span class="bg-yellow border border-yellow-dark px-2">Houses</span> are illiquid and slow to buy and sell
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sources of new Money</h2>
<p>There are four main sources of new money:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Private Debt</span>
</li>
<li><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Government Debt</span>
</li>
<li><ctext color="green-dark" text="Currency"></ctext>
</li>
<li><span class="bg-purple-light border border-purple px-2">Foreign Trade</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can now use our understanding of Money, Assets and Liabilities to look at the effects these sources have.</p>
