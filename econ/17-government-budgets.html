  <h1>17 Government Budgets</h1>
<p>Summarising our work so far, we can reach some conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p>To achieve a stable economy, the Bank of England must target the level of <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-1">GNI</span> over a range of future years, making up for any missed targets</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If total <span class="bg-orange-light border border-orange px-2">Savings</span> grow too high, the Structural Multiplier <sm></sm> will fall below 100%, and new money must be created each year to keep growth on track</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span class="bg-red-light border border-red px-2">Debt</span> is a source of new money, and brings non-financial benefits, but slows future growth, lowers the Structural Multiplier <mult-down></mult-down> and leads to worse recessions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A <span class="bg-purple-light border border-purple px-2">Current Account</span> surplus is a source of new money, but not all countries can simultaneously run one, and the United Kingdom runs a significant deficit at present</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Quantitative Easing provides a temporary source of new money, but will increase the value of Savings <debt-up></debt-up><equity-up></equity-up> and decrease the Structural Multiplier <mult-down></mult-down></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> printed by the Bank of England is the final source of new money, and can also prevent a build up of Savings</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The government must choose how this new <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> is spent, and also needs a way to remove it if <span class="bg-grey-light border border-grey px-1">GNI growth</span> needs to be slowed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads us towards a new way of handling government budgets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Bank of England forecasts future levels of <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-1">GNI</span>, and estimates how much more or less <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> it expects the economy to need to meet its targets</p>
</li>
<li><p>These future adjustments are published and updated in real-time, so as to avoid market volatility around publishing dates</p>
</li>
<li><p>The government budget for each year is set to equal the expected tax receipts for that year, plus/minus the adjustment from the Bank of England</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the adjustment is positive, <span class="bg-green-light border border-green px-2">Currency</span> is paid by the Bank of England to the government; if it is negative, the government pays the Bank of England</p>
</li>
<li><p>If <span class="bg-grey-light border border-grey px-1">GNI growth</span> turns out to be too high/low, the Bank of England revises future adjustments to bring future levels of <span class="bg-grey border border-grey-dark px-1">GNI</span> back in line, and the government in turn must revise its budget</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>This would be a significantly departure from current policy, but comes with a number of interesting results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protection from bad governments</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a constant tension between the parties in the UK parliament when they discuss government spending. Both sides primarily use this as a political stick to hit the other with, rather than as a means to achieve their actual goals. Bad governments currently have the power to borrow and spend far too much, or far too little, without any consequences.</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider the effects of removing this power from them. Governments who choose to focus on traditional left-wing/high-MM spending (e.g. increased benefits for low earners, tax rises on high earners) would see future adjustment payments from the Bank of England fall. In contrast, traditional right-wing/low-MM spending (e.g. lower corporation tax and income tax) would lead to future adjustments rising. This is a self-balancing mechanism that would help curb the excesses of both sides.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No need for Government Debt</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The government would no longer need to issue bonds. They could, however, still aim to issue a nominal amount each year so that the market has liquid safe assets to infer the risk-free yield curve from.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forecasting</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bank of England would have a difficult job in forecasting the effects of policy changes, but publishing these forecasts in real-time would make things so much easier as they will be able to see how markets react to small changes.</p>
<p>They will also have the interesting choice of choosing at what approximate level they want to keep interest rates. Currently, with rates so low, they would need to stimulate growth far enough that rates could be increased safely, but once rates have risen they will then have two policy levers to adjust.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>But doesnâ€™t this debase the currency?</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We saw earlier how rising incomes would cause inflation via increased demand for goods and services, yet prices would stay the same in real terms. Focusing on the headline inflation numbers without considering all the other benefits we get from rising incomes misses the wood for the trees.</p>
