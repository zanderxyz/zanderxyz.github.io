</script><p>The four main things governments spend money on are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Redistribution</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Shifting income from the wealthy to the less wealthy, by either varying the level of income taxes or by making direct benefit payments</p>
<p>This moves the income from those with a low MM to those with a high MM, so will, in the short term, increase the Structural Multiplier and GNI growth. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><mult-up></mult-up><income-up></income-up></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Building bridges, roads and public transport lines.</p>
<p>The return on these projects can be highly variable, but generally speaking those that are in poorer areas or that affect the most people will have the larger positive effects on GNI. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up></p>
<p>It is also important that as much as possible is spent within the country so that the money can circulate after being spent. If the government buys trains from abroad, then even if they were cheaper than home-made trains it is highly likely that they have made a worse overall deal as that money will immediately leave the local economy. The Multiplier will be close to zero. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-flat></gni-flat></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Education</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Spending on schools, teachers, university education, and university research.</p>
<p>The costs of education have ballooned over the last 50 years, even adjusting for inflation. University courses used to be free, and government spending on primary and secondary education was far lower per pupil. Teacher wages have fallen over the same period, so the money isn’t going there. And there hasn’t been any measurable increase in quality to justify this either. If anything, you’d expect advances in technology and manufacturing to decrease costs over time.</p>
<p>This phenomenon where costs for services have risen disproportionately and for no clear reason is known as Cost Disease. There is an excellent article about this on <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/">Slate Star Codex</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for this is likely that Education is a superior good, which means that as a country gets richer it will spend an increasing proportion of its income on it. There is also no limit to how much Education one can “consume”, unlike other superior goods like steak. The marginal impact of additional spending is basically zero, but there is a bias towards spending more anyway.</p>
<p>Most education spending goes on Consumption so this will have a high multiplier. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Spending on doctors, hospitals, drugs, and research.</p>
<p>Healthcare is another superior good, like Education, and suffers from the same Cost Disease.</p>
<p>Government healthcare spending can increase or decrease future GNI depending on how much of the expenditure ends up being paid as wages vs dividends or interest. Generally a public system will spend more on wages, and a private system will spend more on profits.</p>
<p>Ultimately decisions on Healthcare spending should be based on improving patient outcomes and any effects on GNI offset elsewhere.</p>
