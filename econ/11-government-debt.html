  <h1>11 Government Debt</h1>
<p>When the government spends more in one year than they receive in tax receipts, the difference is known as their budget deficit. To fund this spending they issue bonds with value equal to the deficit. This Government Debt is very similar to the Private Debt of a very safe borrower, with the same effects. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><mult-down></mult-down><income-down></income-down></p>
<h2>Productive Debt</h2>
<p>We can define Debt (whether Private or Government) as productive if the benefits gained by the borrower are greater than the amount of interest they must pay. These benefits do not necessarily need to be financial - a student who borrows money for their education is often making a good long-term decision.</p>
<p>Attempting to quantify non-financial benefits is a fool’s errand - much better to assume that all Debt is <em>intended</em> to be productive. Ahead of time there is no guarantee that somebody’s new business will succeed, or that the value of their new house won’t crash, but in most cases these are not bad investments. Outside extreme cases like borrowing to pay for an expensive wedding, Debt is not inherently a bad thing.</p>
<p>We know that despite the initial boost to GNI from new Debt, the ongoing financial costs will slow future GNI growth across the economy. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><mult-down></mult-down><income-down></income-down></p>
<p>If we want the non-financial benefits then we must offset this drag on GNI growth with another source of new money that doesn’t have an ongoing cost. That source is the Bank of England.</p>
