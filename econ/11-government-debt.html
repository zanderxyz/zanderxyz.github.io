  <h1>11 Government Debt</h1>
<p>When a government spends more in one year than they receive in tax receipts, the difference is known as their budget deficit. In order to fund this spending they must issue bonds with  value equal to the deficit. This Government Debt is very similar to the Private Debt of a very safe borrower, with the same effects.</p>
<p>The four main things governments spend money on are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Redistribution</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Shifting income from the wealthy to the less wealthy, by either varying the level of income taxes or by making direct benefit payments</p>
<p>This moves the income from those with a low MM to those with a high MM, so will, in the short term, increase the Structural Multiplier and GNI growth. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><mult-up></mult-up><income-up></income-up></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Building bridges, roads and public transport lines.</p>
<p>The return on these projects can be highly variable, but generally speaking those that are in poorer areas or that affect the most people will have the larger positive effects on GNI. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up></p>
<p>It is also important that as much as possible is spent within the country so that the money can circulate after being spent. If the government buys trains from abroad, then even if they were cheaper than home-made trains it is highly likely that they have made a worse overall deal as that money will immediately leave the local economy. The Multiplier will be close to zero. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-flat></gni-flat></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Education</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Spending on schools, teachers, university education, and university research.</p>
<p>The costs of education have ballooned over the last 50 years, even adjusting for inflation. University courses used to be free, and government spending on primary and secondary education was far lower per pupil. Teacher wages have fallen over the same period, so the money isn’t going there. And there hasn’t been any measurable increase in quality to justify this either. If anything, you’d expect advances in technology and manufacturing to decrease costs over time.</p>
<p>This phenomenon where costs for services have risen disproportionately and for no clear reason is known as Cost Disease. There is an excellent article about this on <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/">Slate Star Codex</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for this is likely that Education is a superior good, which means that as a country gets richer it will spend an increasing proportion of its income on it. There is also no limit to how much Education one can “consume”, unlike other superior goods like steak. The marginal impact of additional spending is basically zero, but there is a bias towards spending more anyway.</p>
<p>Most education spending goes on Consumption so this will have a high multiplier. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Spending on doctors, hospitals, drugs, and research.</p>
<p>Healthcare is another superior good, like Education, and suffers from the same Cost Disease.</p>
<p>Government healthcare spending can increase or decrease future GNI depending on how much of the expenditure ends up being paid as wages vs dividends or interest. Generally a public system will spend more on wages, and a private system will spend more on profits.</p>
<p>Ultimately decisions on Healthcare spending should be based on improving patient outcomes and any effects on GNI offset elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Productive Debt</h2>
<p>We can define Debt (whether Private or Government) as productive if the benefits gained by the borrower are greater than the amount of interest they must pay. The benefits do not necessarily need to be financial - a student who borrows money for their education is often making a good long-term decision.</p>
<p>Attempting to quantify non-financial benefits is a fool’s errand - much better to assume that all Debt is <em>intended</em> to be productive. Ahead of time there is no guarantee that somebody’s new business will succeed, or that the value of their new house won’t crash, but in most cases these are not bad investments. Outside extreme cases like borrowing to pay for an expensive wedding, Debt is not inherently a bad thing.</p>
<p>If the benefits of new Debt are mostly non-financial, then despite the initial boost to GNI, the ongoing financial costs will slow future GNI growth across the economy. <debt-plus></debt-plus><arrow></arrow><gni-up></gni-up><mult-down></mult-down><income-down></income-down></p>
<p>If we want the non-financial benefits of Debt then we must offset this drag on GNI growth with another source of new money that doesn’t have an ongoing cost. That source is the Bank of England.</p>
