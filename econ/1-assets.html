  <h1>1 Assets</h1>
<p>First, we need to start off with some wide definitions to set up our model. We are deliberately looking at things differently, so rather than try and fit these definitions into your existing view of the world, try and fit the world into these definitions.</p>
<p>We’ll start by defining three groups, which represent all assets that can be held, and a fourth group representing anything else that people may buy.</p>
<ol>
<li><ctext color="green-dark" text="Currency"></ctext>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All money created by the Royal Mint and Bank of England, it comes in both physical (banknotes and coins) and electronic forms. The value of Currency does not change, as it is the “Medium of Account” and other prices are quoted in terms of it. Regardless of its relative value, £1 is always £1.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><ctext color="red-dark" text="Debt"></ctext>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This represents any Currency you are owed by somebody else.</p>
<blockquote><p>Money in your bank account is Debt, as it is owed to you by the bank</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li><ctext color="yellow-dark" text="Equity"></ctext>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All other permanent assets: houses, shares &amp; commodities such as gold.</p>
<p>In the case of shares in companies, Equity measures the value of the company after subtracting any Currency and any Debt it holds and owes. This means that Equity can only grow gradually, and cannot suddenly jump or fall in value by issuing new shares or Debt, or by buying Debt.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><ctext color="blue-dark" text="Consumption"></ctext>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anything temporary, such as services, food and drink, clothes, intermediate goods used in the production of other goods, or government transfers like benefits. Although some of these are in theory permanent (such as clothes), we treat them as if they cease to exist after being purchased - since the benefits are purely non-financial, we exclude them from the model.</p>
<blockquote><p>If a business invests in building a factory to increase their future profitability, the expenditure would count as Consumption, although it would increase the value of the company once complete TODO</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Total Assets</h3>
<p>All Assets in the economy are either Currency, Equity or Debt, although the exact proportions of each will vary.</p>
